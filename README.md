# Stock Price Prediction using Keras LSTM

This Python script predicts stock prices using Keras LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The code fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, builds an LSTM model, trains the model, and visualizes the predictions against actual stock prices.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas_datareader
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- matplotlib
- yfinance

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas_datareader numpy pandas scikit-learn Keras matplotlib yfinance
